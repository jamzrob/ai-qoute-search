Developing a natural immunity to the turistas and giardia is not an easy passage, but if you refuse to take Flagyl and antibiotics and don’t drink iodine-treated or chlorinated water, the immunity gradually happens

Have you ever thought, not only about the airplane but whatever man builds, that all of man’s industrial efforts, all his computations and calculations, all the nights spent working over draughts and blue-prints, invariably culminate in the production of a thing whose sole and guiding principle is the ultimate principle of simplicity?It

One of my favorite sayings about entrepreneurship is: If you want to understand the entrepreneur, study the juvenile delinquent. The delinquent is saying with his actions, “This sucks. I’m going to do my own thing.” Since I had never wanted to be a businessman, I needed a few good reasons to be one. One thing I did not want to change, even if we got serious: Work had to be enjoyable on a daily basis. We all had to come to work on the balls of our feet and go up the stairs two steps at a time. We needed to be surrounded by friends who could dress whatever way they wanted, even be barefoot.

I’ve always thought of myself as an 80 percenter. I like to throw myself passionately into a sport or activity until I reach about an 80 percent proficiency level. To go beyond that requires an obsession and degree of specialization that doesn’t appeal to me

Yet you can’t wait until you have all the answers before you act. It’s often a greater risk to phase in products because you lose the advantage of being first with a new idea.

Our insurance company refused to fight any of the suits and settled out of court. Our insurance premiums went up 2,000 percent in one year. Eventually Chouinard Equipment Ltd. filed for Chapter 11, a move that gave the employees time to gather capital for a buyout. They

I’ve been a student of Zen philosophy for many years. In Zen archery, for example, you forget about the goal—hitting the bull’s-eye—and instead focus on all the individual movements involved in shooting an arrow. You practice your stance, reaching back and smoothly pulling an arrow out of the quiver, notching it on the string, controlling your breathing, and letting the arrow release itself. If you’ve perfected all the elements, you can’t help but hit the center of the target. The same philosophy is true for climbing mountains. If you focus on the process of climbing, you’ll end up on the summit

If everyone thinks you have a good idea, you’re too late.—PAUL HAWKEN

Business is a race to see who can be the first to bring a product to the customer, and inventions and ideas are often born simultaneously around the world by any number of unrelated individuals. It’s almost as if every idea had its time.
---
Being first offers tremendous marketing advantages, not the least of which is you have no competition. Coming in second, even with a superior product at a better price, is often no substitute for just plain being first. This doesn’t mean we should be “chasing” trends or products. It applies more to “discovering” a new fabric or a new process. Again, the key word is discovering instead of inventing. There’s simply no time for inventing.

Computers don’t screw up; people screw up. Garbage in, garbage out

“I didn’t have the time” or “I’ve been too busy” to answer your letter, to return your call, to write a weekly report, to clean my desk, whatever. This is a dishonest excuse. What the person really means is that the job didn’t get done because it had the lowest priority, and in fact he may never return your call because he really doesn’t want to. People do what they want to do.

On the contrary, sales representatives, shop owners, salesclerks, and people in focus groups are usually not visionaries.

For centuries in Ireland, women hand knit sweaters for their seafaring husbands. The bulky, cable-stitched wool was constructed to ward off harsh elements. Each woman used a recognizable, family-specific pattern of stitches, both to reflect love and pride, but also to be used as a means of identification if the husband were lost at sea and his body washed ashore.

In the past, recessions have hurt our competitors and driven customers to us because people became less frivolous in their purchases. They didn’t mind paying more for goods that won’t go out of style and are of such quality that they will last a long time.

We do not create artificial demand for our goods by advertising in Vanity Fair or GQ or on buses in inner cities, hoping to get kids to buy their black down jackets from us instead of The North Face or Timberland. We want customers who need our clothing, not just desire it.

A master in the art of living draws nosharp distinction between his work andhis play; his labor and his leisure; hismind and his body; his education andhis recreation. He hardly knowswhich is which. He simply pursues his visionof excellence through whatever he isdoing, and leaves others to determinewhether he is working or playing.To himself, he always appearsto be doing both.—FRANÇOIS AUGUSTE RENÉ CHATEAUBRIAND

A study done of the most successful CEOs in America (not the celebrity CEOs, but those who, without fanfare and jumping jobs every few years, get the work done) found one factor they all have in common: They enjoy working with their hands. The older ones had cars that they worked on in high school (when you could still work on your own car) or had wood shops in their garages where they made furniture

Recently I stood on the terrible ramparts of the Bonneville Dam, a site where once a trillion salmon swam freely by, and I knew then where the devil himself lived, not in some imagined fiery cavern, but there inside the ice-cold concrete and steel. This was the epicenter of hell, where Satan could murder the river and its children again and again, ruling over an empire of satellite hells, committing similar murder. The roar of the strangled water was like a raging howl of fear and loathing.

They found that the economic benefits of intact nature, in climate regulation, soil formation, nutrients cycling, and fuel, food, fibers, and pharmaceutical products from wild species, outstripped exploitation by a conservative estimate of a hundred to one.They also posited the question, “What would be the economic value of increasing the world’s paltry annual outlay of $6.5 billion for habitat preservation to $45 billion, enough to create meaningful contiguous wild land reserves?” They estimated nature’s resulting gift back to the economy at $440 trillion to $520 trillion

The problem is a failure of the imagination. In the sycophantic biography of George W. Bush The Right Man: The Surprise Presidency of George W. Bush, by David Frum, the worst thing said about him is that he was “uncurious.” Uncurious people do not lead examined lives; they cannot see causes that lie deeper than the surface

And people who believe the end of the world is around the corner can’t be expected, as the journalist Glenn Scherer wrote in the online environmental magazine Grist, “to worry about the environment. Why care about the earth when the droughts, floods, famine and pestilence brought by ecological collapse are signs of the apocalypse foretold in the Bible?”

have a different definition of evil from most people. Evil doesn’t have to be an overt act; it can be merely the absence of good. If you have the ability, the resources, and the opportunity to do good and you do nothing, that can be evil.

A certain void exists now with the decline of so many good institutions that used to guide our lives, such as social clubs, religions, athletic teams, neighborhoods, and nuclear families, all of which had a unifying effect. They gave us a sense of belonging to a group, working toward a common goal. People still need an ethical center, a sense of their role in society
