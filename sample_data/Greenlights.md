Norvel,” I growled, “you get your fat fucking ass out of my way or I am going to beat you to the ground and drag you across your gravel driveway for so long that you are gonna be pullin rocks outta your back until the day you fucking DIE!

Only later did I come to realize that the suffering and loneliness I experienced would be one of the most important sacrifices of my life.

And while I was going crazy, I kept telling myself that there was a lesson I was put there to learn, that there was a silver lining in all of it, that I needed to go through hell to get to the other side, and I did. We cannot fully appreciate the light without the shadows. We have to be thrown off balance to find our footing. It’s better to jump than fall. And here I am.

We gotta keep an eye on him, though, he’s got a berserker switch, he’s a little bit crazy.

You’re gonna love it, buddy, it is your kinda town. You can walk into anywhere in your flip-flops, have a seat at a bar, and you’ll have a cowboy to the right of you, a lesbian to your left, an Indian on the other side, and a midget tendin bar. All you gotta be is yourself in that town

TV off, not interested.I looked around the room. On the floor to the left of me was a stack of magazines. Playboys, Hustlers. Now, I love women, and I love looking at naked women. But for some reason, not today. Not interested

Some get the genes but never the work ethic or resilience.Others work their ass off but never had the innate ability.Others have both and never rely on the first.

They want to see a product. A film, a performance, something. The only reason I’m skipping class is to go out into the world and try and make something that those people will want to purchase. I’m chasing things outside of the classroom that the classroom is teaching me to chase

less impressed,more involved

The sooner we become less impressed with our life, our accomplishments, our career, our relationships, the prospects in front of us—the sooner we become less impressed and more involved with these things—the sooner we get better at them. We must be more than just happy to be here

The introvert may need to get out of the house, engage with the world, get public.The extrovert may need to stay home and read a book.Sometimes we need to get out there, sometimes we need to get in there.Some days our road less traveled is a solitary dirt trail.On others it’s the subway on the 7 line.

the INTELLECTIs not meant to surpass the apparent so far as to conceal it or make it more confusing.It is meant to expose the truth more clearly and reveal more of the obvious from more lines of sight.It should simplify things, not make them more cerebral.

I did learn a good lesson that day, though.We have to prepare to have freedom.We have to do the work to then do the job.We have to prepare for the job so we can be free to do the work.Knowing my man does not mean I know Spanish.

For some reason, either by your own incompetence or the world’s intervention, it did not happen.Sometimes this is just the breaks and we need to bow out gracefully.

ran off into the night until I was about a mile away from anyone. Then, with tears in my eyes, I dropped to my knees, faced that full moon, extended my right hand up to it, and said,“Thank you.”
---
I have.What happens when we get that feeling? We clench up, get short of breath, self-conscious. We have an out-of-body experience where we observe ourselves in the third person, no longer present, now not doing well what we are there to do. We become voyeurs of our moment because we let it become bigger than us, and in doing so, we just became less involved in it and more impressed with it

We need to put ourselves in places of decreased sensory input so we can hear the background signals of our psychological processes.

GMC Savana van and tricked it out to suit my fancies. I gutted the interior except for the two front captain chairs, and installed a custom-made console with a hideaway cooler and drain, a PA system like I had in my high school truck, and a Rode NT1-A shock-mounted microphone on the end of a bendable arm connected to a cassette recorder that was mounted into the ceiling above the driver’s seat so I could make high-end voice recordings while driving down the road. Many have been transcribed and are in this book. I spent ten grand on an Alpine amp, Tancredi equalizer, and Focal ES speakers for a top-end vintage sound system, fixed a leopard-skin couch-bed in the back, and drilled a hole in the floor to fit an oil funnel so I could take a pee without having to pull over. I named that van “Cosmo

Then I got offered the role of Denton Van Zan in the film Reign of Fire. Van Zan was a cigar-gnawing, apocalyptic badass dragon slayer who ate the heart of every dragon he slayed and carried a dwarf around on his shoulder. The dwarf on the shoulder part later got cut out of the script but I always loved it. I immediately had an understanding and a need for a character like Van Zan
---
Great characters earn my respect and Van Zan was one who didn’t so much get the madness out of my system as he made me own more of my own. He elevated my expectations of what it takes to survive and reminded me that duty is worth more than the vanities of a home field advantage. His tomahawk still hangs on the wall behind my back in my office today

Why would we define things that are incredible and awesome, things that actually make us believe in them more, with this pillar of antonymy? Something spectacular, phenomenal, outstanding, and most excellent, is most definitely not, unbelievable

enjoyed being able to give people a ninety-minute breezy romantic getaway from the stress of their lives where they didn’t have to think about anything, just watch the boy chase the girl, fall down, then get up and finally get her. I had taken the baton from Hugh Grant, and I ran with it

SEX—The original exercise. It generates a sweat from within and improves relationships, making our companion see us in a more flattering light, which psychologically makes us feel like we look better.

Acting was feeling like a means to an end that I had no address for, and if this was all acting was for me, then I wasn’t sure I wanted to act.

You ever get in a rut? Stuck on the merry-go-round of a bad habit? I have. We are going to make mistakes — own them, make amends, and move on. Guilt and regret kill many a man before their time. Get off the ride. You are the author of the book of your life. Turn the page.

We’ve all encountered those people, who, out of the corner of our eye, from across the street, at magic hour, appear astoundingly attractive, even God- or Goddess-like. The way they move, the way the light hits them, invokes reverence and awe. The IMPRESSION

I’m not talking about those obligations. I’m talking about the ones we make with ourselves. The YOU versus YOU obligations. Not the societal regulations and expectations that we acknowledge and endow for anyone other than ourselves, these are faith-based responsibilities that we make on our own, the ones that define our constitution and character.

I needed three hours less sleep a night and could drink a bottle of wine until 2:00 a.m. and still be up at four to work on the script without an alarm clock. Feverishly obsessed with my man, I was on fire, and I loved it. The downfall was that while my mental game was on the mound in Game 7 of the World Series, the extreme weight loss seemed to relegate my libido to the dugout

loved the work, the process, the construction, the architecture of building and owning my man. I loved having a wife who never interrupted my belief that each role I played was the only, and last, role I’d ever play. I loved acting more than ever.

Time to catch that hero I’ve been chasing, see if the sun will melt the wax that holds my wings or if the heat is just a mirage. Live my legacy now. Quit acting like me. Be me.

In each place I looked myself in the eye. All fifty years of me. It was a scary proposition. Alone with the one person responsible for all of it. The one person I can’t get rid of. I wasn’t sure I’d like what I saw. I knew it could get bloody.
